Predict Comment Score

Problem Statement

Ponder is a platform for sharing your thoughts, or promoting some personal stuff and everything. Not only that it is also a very good place to check to keep yourself with what is happening around the world. But it has a very strict posting policy, and getting credits for good comments are really. You’re someone who has just started to use Ponder as a new user, you want to predict whether your comment is going to receive a good score or not.

Given a dataset of past comments and their scores (training dataset), you have to build a model that can predict scores of comments present in the test dataset.
